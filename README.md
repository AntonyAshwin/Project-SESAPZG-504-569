# Project-SESAPZG-504-569
Hi All,  I am Antony Ashwin (2023sl93002). I am currently completing my 3rd semester of M.Tech in Software Engineering through the Work Integrated Learning program at BITS Pilani. This is my combined final project assignment for the courses 24_SESAPZG504 and 24_SESAPZG569.


HOW TO LOCALLY RUN IT 

1. Clone this repo 
2. Get the .env file from me or you can just make one yourself
    PORT=8080
    MONGO_URI= <mongodb uri to connect to the cluster>
    JWT_SECRET= <your jwt secret key>
3. npm install - will install all dependencies, you might have to instal jsonwebtoken again - not sure why
4. npm start
5. no frontend so far so please reach out to me to get the postman env and collections -you can create them on your own aswell after looking at the model and the routes
